Here the genes tree and unique-common table are generated for the paper.
Inputs: The xlsx file in this directory 
(RNA-HADAS-FIXED-NAMES.xlsx generated in RNA/HEATMAPS&HISTOGRAMS/CODE directory).
Output: The visualziation of the pearson and spearman genes tree and table. (in the Jupyter notebook)

NOTES:
1. We create two kinds of trees:
a. intersection-based with table of unique and common genes for each branch in each split.
b. local intersection-based: unique genes in each split 
(as in the unique columns in the table of the tree in a).
2. Analysis is done on Lysis
