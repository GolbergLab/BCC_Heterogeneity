Here the proteins tree and unique-common table are generated for the paper.
Inputs: The xlsx file in this directory 
(proteinGroups-lysis-new-old-outer-join.csv generated in PROTEINS/HEATMAPS&HISTOGRAMS/CODE directory).
Output: The visualziation of the pearson and spearman proteins tree and table. (in the Jupyter notebook)

NOTES:
1. We create two kinds of trees:
a. intersection-based with table of unique and common proteins for each branch in each split.
b. local intersection-based: unique proteins in each split 
(as in the unique columns in the table of the tree in a).
2. There is a dataset for control group (same sample, 5 different LCMS outputs).
3. Analysis is done on Lysis
